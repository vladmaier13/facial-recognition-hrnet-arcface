# Facial Recognition System (HRNet + ArcFace)

This repository contains the core code from my bachelor thesis:
**"Facial Recognition System based on HRNet architecture and ArcFace loss"**

## Overview
- Feature extraction using HRNet
- ArcFace loss for robust facial embeddings
- Comparison with Softmax + Cross-Entropy

## Results
- Demonstrated robust recognition on a curated subset of MS1M-ArcFace dataset.

## Technologies
Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV

## Note
The dataset and trained weights are not included due to size restrictions.
